# what i've learned :


## HTML5 Layout:

In the past develpoers used non-semantic elements to built ther web pages 
non-semantic elements  like div tag it's hard to track, then HTML 5 introduces semantic elements that's make our code logical and  more readable .
### semantic elements that we use in html page:
~~~~ 
* <header> : form it name it's appears at the top of a web page 
* <nav>: it's usually be in the <header> and contains our links
* <main>: it's contain the main contant of our page
* <article>: it's a container for any section of a page 
* <footer>it's appears at the bottom of a web page


### Extra Markup:
* <DOCTYPE>: it's a declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using 
* <!-- -->: this tag is using to add one line or multipul lines comment
* ID Attribute " it's  used to uniquely identify the element , id is global attribute it's means that every element in HTML can use it 
* class attribute : it's use to  identify elements
* <div>: it's container for other html elements
* ^ <iframe>: is used to embed another page within the current HTML Page
