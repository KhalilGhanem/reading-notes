# Trees

## Common Terminology:
* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversals:
* Depth First: Is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
    
    * The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion.
    * Depth First traversal methods:

        * Pre-order: root >> left >> right
        * In-order: left >> root >> right
        * Post-order: left >> right >> root


* Breadth First: Iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

    * breadth first traversal uses a queue

## K-ary Trees:
If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.
