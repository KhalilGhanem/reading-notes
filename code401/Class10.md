# Stacks & Queues

## Stack:
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

**stack terminology**
* Push: Add a new node to the stack
* pop: Removed a node from the stack
* Top: The top node of the stack
* peek: The value of the top Node in the stack
* IsEmpty:Returns true when stack is empty

**Stacks follow these concepts:**
* First In Last Out(FILO)
* Last In First Out(LIFO)

## Queue:
A Queue is a linear ordered data structure.

**Queue terminology**
* Enqueue:Add a new node to the queue
* Dequeue: Removed a node from the queue
* Front: The first Node of the queue
* Rear: The last Node of the queue
* Peek: The value of the front Node in the queue
* IsEmpty:Returns true when queue is empty

**Queue follow these concepts:**
* First In First Out(FIFO)
* Last In Last Out(LILO)
