Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.

## Advantages of using Amazon S3

* Creating buckets – Create and name a bucket that stores data.

## Amazon S3 concepts

* Buckets: A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3.

  Buckets serve several purposes:

  * They organize the Amazon S3 namespace at the highest level.
  * They identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer charges.
  * They play a role in access control.
  * They serve as the unit of aggregation for usage reporting.
* Objects: Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and metadata.
* Keys: A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket.
* Regions: You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the buckets that you create.
