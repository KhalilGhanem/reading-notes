# Hash Tables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value

## Terminology:
* Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose.
* Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable.
* Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Why do we use them?
1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

## Internal Methods
