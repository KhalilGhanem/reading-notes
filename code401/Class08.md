# OO Design

## SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design

SOLID stands for:

* S - Single-responsiblity Principle

   Which means that a class should have only one job.

* O - Open-closed Principle

   Which means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
     
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle

   Which means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class. 

* I - Interface Segregation Principle

  Which means that clients forced ti depend on methods or interfaces that they dont use.

* D - Dependency Inversion Principle

  Which means that Entities must depend on abstractions.
