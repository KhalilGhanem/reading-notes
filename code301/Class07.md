1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    He helped write the first web servers HTTP and His name is on the specification for the HTTP protocol.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    It is all about verbs(get,put,etc) that can be applied to nouns, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
