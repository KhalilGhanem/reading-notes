## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack
1. What is a ‘call’?

    a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

    it can only do one thing at a time.

3. What does LIFO mean?

    Last In, First Out, which basically means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
    
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
