## Basic HTML page structure:


```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
   <head>
        <title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
   </head>
    <body>
    <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
    <p>Anything within the body of a web page is 
       displayed in the main browser window.</p>
    </body>
</html>

  <head> element contains information about the page.
  <title> The content inside it will be shown in the page's tab.
  <body> The content inside it will be displayed in a browser.
```

### Extra Markup:
```
* <DOCTYPE>: it's a declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using .
* <!-- -->: this tag is using to add one line or multipul lines comment.
* ID Attribute " it's  used to uniquely identify the element , id is global attribute it's means that every element in HTML can use it. 
* class attribute : it's use to  identify elements.
* <div>: it's container for other html elements.
* ^ <iframe>: is used to embed another page within the current HTML Page.

### Elements Types:
* Block Elements :will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.
* inline Elements : will always appear to continue on the same line.

### Escape Characters:
* &    &amp;
* "    &quot; 
* Â©    &copy;
``` 

## HTML5 Layout:

In the past develpoers used non-semantic elements to built ther web pages.
non-semantic elements  like div tag it's hard to track, then HTML 5 introduces semantic elements that's make our code logical and  more readable .

### semantic elements that we use in html page:
```
* <header>: form it name it's appears at the top of a web page 
* <nav>: it's usually be in the <header> and contains our links
* <main>: it's contain the main contant of our page
* <article>: it's a container for any section of a page 
* <footer>: it's appears at the bottom of a web page
* <hgroup>: it used to group heading elements
* <figure>: it used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article
```

### How do computers fit in with the world around them?
Computer creat models of the world using data.

#### Objects & properties:
* Objects: each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object.
* properties: the characteristics of an object, each propertie have it name and value.

#### Event:
An event is the computer's way of sticking up its hand to say, "Hey, this just happened!" 

event can be used to trigger a specific section of the code. 

#### Methods:

Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an 
object's properties.*

#### How a browser sees a web page
